# Implementation of Unforgeable Polynomials on Smart Contract


This contract provides efficient modular arithmetic and flexible verification of degree-3 polynomial tags over a large prime field. It is designed for scenarios where you need to check polynomial relationships and divisibility on-chain, e.g., for cryptographic protocols, verifiable computation, or privacy-preserving applications.


## How to Use on Remix

1. Deploying the Contract
   1.1. Open Remix IDE.
   
   1.2. Create a new file (e.g., FlexibleTagVerifier.sol) and paste the contract code.
   
   1.3 Select the correct Solidity compiler version (e.g., 0.8.20 or higher).
   
   1.4. Compile the contract.

   1.5. Deploy the contract from the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel. You donâ€™t need to provide any constructor parameters.
